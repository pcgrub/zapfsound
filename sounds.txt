# sounds config for zapfsound soundboard
#
# to add a sound just simply add a line with the path of your sound file.
#
# sound files need to be in .wav format and only the first 10 sounds
# will be added.
#
# sounds that are too long will be replaced by a default sound.
# if less than 10 sounds are given empty the remaining sound spaces will also be
# filled up with the default sound.
